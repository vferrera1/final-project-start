My backyard is kind of small, so I don't know how much I am physically able to grow. I am also not sure which fruits/vegetables thrive most in the climate of my backyard. 

## Aesthetic Gardener:

Hello I am an Aesthetic Gardener, the most important thing to me is that my garden is the talk of the town.

*What is your main goal?*:
I want an application that can help me maximize the ammount of space used in my garden so i dont have any holes in my presentation. I also want to make sure this year's planned color pallet looks just as good in my yard as it does in my head.

*What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?*
I really want to try out my design now but dont want to spent hundreds of dollars on plants yet. I would really like a way to preview what it might look like!!

## Botanist:

*Who are you?*
I am an amateur scientist interested in researching different species of plants.

*What is your main goal?*  
My goal is to design a garden based on species of plant and similar characteristics in different regions.
I am interested in all sorts of native plants and wish to investigate them in this garden.

*What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?*  
I need a strong tool to be able to view plants based on different characteristics. I need to be able
to change the characteristics I am filtering by to show more or less plants depending on how I want
to organize them.
