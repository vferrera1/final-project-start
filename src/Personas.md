Teacher:
    *Who are you?*
    I am a teacher. I have a class of preschool students.
    *What is your main goal?*
    I want to teach my students about basic colors and shapes. I want it to be educational and engaging for the students.
    *What is your main barrier to achieving this goal?*
    I have a lot of students and cannot work with all of them individually. I want all of my students to have hands-on experience working with colors and shapes. I also want a simple and engaging activity that all of them can use.
Parent: 
    *Who are you?*
    I am a father of two young (preschool) children.
    *What is your goal(s)?* 
    I really want to get my kids online early, and it would be nice if they can learn something while they do so. I also want them to have fun, so I can do chores/work while they play.
    *What are your main barriers?*
    Internet safety means everything to me, and I want to be absolutely sure that the site I provide for my kids is family friendly.
