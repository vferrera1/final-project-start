## Aesthetic Gardener:
*Who are you?*  

Hello I am an Aesthetic Gardener, the most important thing to me is that my garden is the talk of the town. 

*What is your main goal?*

I want an application that can help me maximize the ammount of space used in my garden so i dont have any holes in my presentation. I also want to make sure this year's planned color pallet looks just as good in my yard as it does in my head. 

*What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?*

I really want to try out my design now but dont want to spent hundreds of dollars on plants yet. I would really like a way to preview what it might look like!!
