Objective: GUI software to allow the user to create and view garden designs using native plants.

- User can identify plant characteristics to narrow plant selection, e.g. light, water, bloom time, food for insects and birds, bloom color, soil reqs

- User is given a menu of plants from which to drag onto the garden area (top view); menu can be sorted/filtered

- Top down view by default

- To begin, use circles/ovals for plant images; plants will be scaled to match garden dimensions

- Land surrounding garden can be labeled (e.g. woods, lawn)

Some special features that client liked:

    ability to "relax" plant characteristics to see more plants
    hover to see plant characteristics
    "window" view from side of garden; requires a separate set of plant images
    irregular shaped gardens allowed (e.g. upload a line drawing)
    garden characteristics can be entered for separate parts of garden and used to narrow plant selection
    ability to place special features (rock, path, tree, etc)
    auto "rate" the garden on:
    	number of animals fed
    	continuous bloom
    	likelihood of success: degree to which plant characteristics match garden
    "save" multiple versions of the garden, be able to reload
    ability to draw garden shape (not just rectangle)

Other special features:

- Plants have bloom, non-bloom, and winter images (these may be shaded ovals/circles); images must appear correctly sized relative to the garden and other plants. User can view garden at different times and images will change.

-  0, 1, 2 years size

      Each team can add special features that they think will be enjoyed by the client. Note that these features should appear in the storyboard so that client can give feedback.
