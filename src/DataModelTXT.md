Have various components that work together to dynamically render this page. We want to split up as much of the work as possible. Data with be stored in the DOM and will keep track of updated data
The app will contain a Board, relavent buttons such as reset button and next button to control the board. The board will have Board Squares which are regions of different colors and where the shapes should correctly be dragged and dropped. There will also be a set of shapes which will be rendered in a separate region of the page. These shapes can be dragged and dropped into the regions of the board.
The "Color Square" regions of the board will have attributes of the color, size dimensions, and position on the board.
The Shapes will have attribute of their shape and color.
The buttons will have functions that control the state of the board. The reset button will revert to the initial state. The Next button will load the next level of the game; as such, it will move to a next initial state of the board and shapes.
