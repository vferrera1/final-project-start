## Aesthetic Gardener:
Who are you?

Hello I am an Aesthetic Gardener, the most important thing to me is that my garden is the talk of the town.

What is your main goal?

I want an application that can help me maximize the ammount of space used in my garden so i dont have any holes in my presentation. I also want to make sure this year's planned color pallet looks just as good in my yard as it does in my head.

What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?

I really want to try out my design now but dont want to spent hundreds of dollars on plants yet. I would really like a way to preview what it might look like!!
## Botanist:
*Who are you?*
I am an amateur scientist interested in researching different species of plants.

*What is your main goal?*  
My goal is to design a garden based on species of plant and similar characteristics in different regions.
I am interested in all sorts of native plants and wish to investigate them in this garden.

*What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?*  
I need a strong tool to be able to view plants based on different characteristics. I need to be able
to change the characteristics I am filtering by to show more or less plants depending on how I want
to organize them.
