## Botanist:
*Who are you?*
I am an amateur scientist interested in researching different species of plants.

*What is your main goal?*  
My goal is to design a garden based on species of plant and similar characteristics in different regions.
I am interested in all sorts of native plants and wish to investigate them in this garden.

*What is your main barrier to acheiving this goal?*  
I need a strong tool to be able to view plants based on different characteristics. I need to be able
to change the characteristics I am filtering by to show more or less plants depending on how I want
to organize them.
