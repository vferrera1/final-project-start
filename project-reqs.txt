General Requirements Fall 2022

A 2d DnD app where dragging an object to a specific x,y has semantics in the domain beyond adding the object to a list. For example, placing a plant in a garden plan on screen models placing a real plant in a real world location. In contrast, dragging an object to a place that assigns it a category is simply adding it to a list and is not acceptable.

Significant back-end logic is not desirable (e.g. games, simulations)

The objects being moved should have attributes:

    an object representing position x, y

    of multiple different types (string, object, bool)

    at least one attribute is a list

    meaningfully sortable, filterable (a list of colors is probably not
    		 meaningfully sortable; a list of flower colors in a garden design
    		 app *is* meaningfully filterable. Ask yourself *why* the user wants to filter)

Required Features:
View previous 2d views of object arrangements and edit
Top down view by default
2d space can change virtual size (e.g. it can be 5 feet or 50 feet; both use screen appropriately)
Filter objects to facilitate customer process
Sort objects to facilitate customer process
Drag objects from selection area to x,y destination (not to a box or list; not snap to grid)
Able to remove objects from selection area or 2d area
Select object in list rep (selection area) or 2d rep and edit attributes (especially list attribute)
Object images scale as 2d space changes virtual size.
30 or more objects with varying attributes in selection area

Optional features:
Multiple characteristics can be specified in increase/relax filter
Add new objects during run
Side view or orthographic view
Hover to see some or all attributes
2d space has facility to upload/change background image
Show user aggregate category information from 2d, e.g. "76 percent of the plants are native."
Objects in 2d change over time (e.g. plants have seasons, or plants grow over time)
Zoom/unZoom
